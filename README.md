To get CryptoRobotics terminal talking to your OKX exchange account, you'll need an API key. Think of it as a secure handshake between the two platformsâ€”your trading terminal can execute trades without you manually logging into the exchange every time.

## Getting Your API Key from OKX

Head over to the OKX website. Look for your profile icon in the upper right corner and click it. You'll see an **API keys** option in the dropdown menu.



Once you're in the API section, click the **Create APIs** button.

A form pops up. Here's what you need to fill in:

- **API name** â€” Give it whatever name makes sense to you
- **Purpose** â€” Select "API trading"
- **Permissions** â€” Tick the **Trade** box (this lets the terminal actually execute trades)
- **Passphrase** â€” Create a passphrase between 6-32 characters. You'll need this later, so save it somewhere safe
- Click **Submit all** when you're done

OKX will ask you to confirm with whatever authentication method you've set upâ€”could be email, SMS, or authenticator app.

Here's the important part: OKX will show you your API credentials. Copy everything and save it somewhere secure. ðŸ‘‰ [Looking for a reliable exchange to power your automated trading strategies?](https://www.okx.com/join/47044926) Once you confirm, you won't see the secret key again.

## Adding the Key to CryptoRobotics

Now switch over to your CryptoRobotics terminal. Go to **Account** â†’ **Exchange Accounts**. If you haven't connected any exchanges yet, you'll see a **Connect Exchange** button at the bottom of the screen.

Click the **+Add New Key** button in the upper right.

A form appears asking for:

- **API Key** â€” Paste what you copied from OKX
- **Secret Key** â€” Same deal
- **Passphrase** â€” The one you created earlier
- **Key name** â€” Whatever helps you remember which account this is

Once everything's filled in, click **+Add new exchange**.

Give it a few seconds to verify. If everything checks out, your OKX account appears in the connected exchanges list.

## One Last Thing: Moving Your Funds

When you first deposit funds to OKX, they land in your Funding Account. But to actually trade, you need them in a Trading account.
